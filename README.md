# Investigate-a-dataset, as part of Udacity data analyst nanodegree program. 
The goal of this project is to analyse a dataset and communicate finding using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

Learnings:
Familarise with all the steps of data analysis preocess
Learn how to pose questions and answering those questions in a data process
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

Project Details
1. Choose to investigate the No-Show medical appointment data.
About the Data:
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
● The encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
2. I cleaned the data using pandas and numpy
3. I created visualisations to analyse and answer some of the questions posed to get a better insight into the data.
4. I created a report to share findings
